Slice Logic Distribution:
  Number of occupied Slices:                 2,136 out of   3,758   56%
  Number of MUXCYs used:                     1,916 out of   7,516   25%
  Number of LUT Flip Flop pairs used:        6,581
    Number with an unused Flip Flop:         2,133 out of   6,581   32%

    Number of slice register sites lost
      to control set restrictions:           1,270 out of  30,064    4%

  A LUT Flip Flop pair for this architecture represents one LUT paired with
  one Flip Flop within a slice.  A control set is a unique combination of
  clock, reset, set, and enable signals for a registered element.
  The Slice Logic Distribution report is not meaningful if the design is
  over-mapped for a non-slice resource or if Placement fails.
